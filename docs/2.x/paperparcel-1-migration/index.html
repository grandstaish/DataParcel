      <h1>Migrating from PaperParcel 1.x</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="main-content">

<p>While PaperParcel 1.x and 2.x have very similar APIs, there has been a several breaking changes (including several APIs having been removed). This guide is intended to help users with the migration process from 1.x to 2.x.</p>

<h2>
<a id="package-change" class="anchor" href="#package-change" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Package Name Change</h2>

<p>The package name of the library has changed from <code>nz.bradcampbell.paperparcel</code> to just <code>paperparcel</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the artifacts are no longer available on jitpack and are instead available on jcenter and mavenCentral under a new group id. See <a href="../../#download">Download</a> for more info.

<h2>
<a id="wrappers" class="anchor" href="#wrappers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wrappers</h2>

<p>PaperParcel used to have a concept of Parcelable wrappers. These no longer exist in 2.x. There are several reasons for removing them:</p>

<ul>
    <li>They require reflection and runtime class lookups, which can be costly on Android (especially when parcelling a lot of model objects at the same time). <code>Parcelable</code> is intended to be performant!</li>
    <li>They don't play well with other libraries that require <code>Parcelable</code>s. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/f2prateek/dart">Dart</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick">IcePick</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sockeqwe/fragmentargs">FragmentArgs</a>. Some of these libraries have APIs for allowing wrapper objects, but it's better practice to just have objects that are <i>actually</i> <code>Parcelable</code> instead.</li>
    <li>Removing them means having fewer method references.</li>
    <li>There were complications with library projects and multi-module projects.</li>
    <li>Wrappers make it harder to opt out of using a library because the wrapping code is usually scattered around both UI and model classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, PaperParcel 2.x just generates the <code>CREATOR</code> and <code>writeToParcel(...)</code> implementations for you. Then you can simply make your model objects implement <code>Parcelable</code> and use/call the generated code from your model.</p>

<p>Here's a list of things you need to do to remove all of the old wrapper-based code:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that all of your <code>@PaperParcel</code> classes also implement <code>Parcelable</code>. Override the required methods, but leave them blank for now.</li>
  <li>If you have references to <code>PaperParcels</code>, delete them next. This class no longer exists as it was only used for wrapping and unwrapping types.</li>
  <li>If you have references to <code>TypedParcelable</code>, you need to delete those too. This interface no longer exists.</li>
  <li>If you have references to <code>PaperParcelable.Creator</code>, you need to delete those too. This was removed in favour of the newly generated <code>CREATOR</code>s that don't rely on wrappers.</li>
  <li>Build and then use the generated code in your models as shown in the <a href="../../#usage">Usage</a> section of the website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="type-adapters" class="anchor" href="#type-adapters" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Type Adapters</h2>

<p>The <code>TypeAdapter</code> API hasn't changed, but the API for registering them has. There isn't really a good reason for having a TypeAdapter with a limited scope. For this reason, PaperParcel has removed the <code>@TypeAdapters</code> API. Additionally, <code>@DefaultAdapter</code> has been renamed to <code>@RegisterAdapter</code>.</p>

<p>While the API is exactly the same, <code>TypeAdapter</code>s have actually gained some new tricks. See <a href="../../#typeadapters">Type Adapters</a> from the website to find out more.</p>
        
<h2>
<a id="proguard" class="anchor" href="#proguard" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proguard</h2>
        
<p>You can delete the old rules associated with this library. PaperParcel 2.x doesn't use reflection anymore. If you're opting into the reflection-enhanced API in <code>paperparcel-kotlin</code>, the rules now ship with the AAR so you don't need to do anything.</p>
